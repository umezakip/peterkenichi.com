				<h1>Curated Colors</h1>
				<p>Curated Colors - an art curation startup, aims to shed light on the smaller artists of today's world.</p>
				<p>Project: Social media posts, apparel, decals, engraved brand tags.</p>
				<p>As one of Curated Colors' designers, the image we reflect is extremely important. Exposure and openness are key when it comes to sucess in the art space. This is the vision we enjoy curating.</p>
				<p>This project revolved around trying to further the brand's marketing. We created a unique clothing tag for each item purchased. These were made of acrylic or wood in a variety of colors. The stickers were requested and were used as an expression of gratitude with every purchase. Finally, we created engaging posts which led more people to follow and believe in a platform for artists made by artists. </p>

				<h1>Freelance Apparel</h1>
				<p>Curated Colors X Santi de Dios</p>
				<p>I have made graphic designs and artwork for both of these small clothing brands. Both these brands requested test samples of embroidered and printed apparel. This included but was not limited to hoodies, sweaters, beanies, and t-shirts. Once the artwork was approved, I then created a mockup so the client would be able to approve placement and color codes.</p>
				<p>Once proofs have been approved I would scale the designs to the requested size, set up files for printing or embroidery, and finally print or stitch the artwork onto the pieces.</p>
